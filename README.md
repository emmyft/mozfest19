## Questions to answer
1. What is the name of your session? 
2. What is the goal or outcome of your session?
3. What will happen in your session?
4. Post-Mozfest how will you continue this work from the session with your participants?
5. How much time you will need? (< 60min / 60min / 90min / All weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session)
6. How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session? What if 30 participants attend? What if there are 3?
7. Session format - choose 1 of the following 3:
   * Learning Forum: Sessions under this format develop and implement ideas for improvement, exchange or review
   * Gallery: This format hosts interactive exhibits, installations, games, stalls- designed for 1:1 self driven experiences or small group activities. Often these experiences or activities are not scheduled time blocks but take place over the day or weekend allowing access and interaction at any time.
   * Workshop: Sessions under this format require hands-on making, hacking and prototyping. These sessions will ask participants to create and build code, objects or crafts

8. Accessibility requirements
9. Language, and whether we would need translation

## Preliminary ideas
* Democratising citation and research evaluation
