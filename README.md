## Questions to answer
1. What is the name of your session? 
Open science soapbox (#ossoapbox)

2. What is the goal or outcome of your session?
Gather open-source innovators and technologists interested in using AI and machine learning to drive forward the ways we discover, consume, share and evaluate research, to foster collaboration within the community and to encourage contributions and participation. 

3. What will happen in your session?
* We will recruit innovators working in this problem space to give lightning talks (3-5 mins) on their current projects and/or ideas. These will be followed by a Q&A session *(can we structure these a bit to facilitate constructive feedback?)* of 5 mins. 
* Spontaneous presentations are encouraged!
* The whole session will be live-streamed; remote participants can present and/or ask questions
* We will try to get people to sketch note and/or live tweets these presentations.
* If projects have live demos, maybe after the soapbox they can stay around with a laptop and let attendees play with the demo?

4. Post-Mozfest how will you continue this work from the session with your participants?
* We will write up a summary of the projects and session to post on [eLife Labs](www.elifesci.org/labs); any presenters/contributors interested can also elaborate on their projects/ideas by pitching a post to Labs.
* We will invite interested participants to share updates on the open-source community call, organised every 4 months (next one is Feb 2020).
* Depending on the level of enthusiasm, we could start a newsletter to keep the community of innovators updated and engaged?

5. How much time you will need? (< 60min / 60min / 90min / All weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session)
Depending on the number of presentations, 60-90mins

6. How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session? What if 30 participants attend? What if there are 3?
If nobody at the venue attends, we would have more in-depth discussions and feedback between the presenters. 
We would love to have more participants of all levels of prior knowledge! This will really allow presenters to get more diverse feedback and hone their communication skills. 

7. Session format - choose 1 of the following 3:
   * Learning Forum: Sessions under this format develop and implement ideas for improvement, exchange or review
   * Gallery: This format hosts interactive exhibits, installations, games, stalls- designed for 1:1 self driven experiences or small group activities. Often these experiences or activities are not scheduled time blocks but take place over the day or weekend allowing access and interaction at any time.
   * Workshop: Sessions under this format require hands-on making, hacking and prototyping. These sessions will ask participants to create and build code, objects or crafts
I think learning forum?

8. Accessibility requirements
* Attendees need to understand English.
* We can try to use Google slide's live captioning to provide captions? Not sure practically if that would work.

9. Language, and whether we would need translation
English â€“ not sure if translation is realistic.
