## Questions to answer
1. What is the name of your session? 

Opening research with AI

2. What is the goal or outcome of your session?

There are currently many projects and initiatives driving forward research communication and open science using emerging technologies and algorithms in AI and machine learning. We would like to use this session to facilitate knowledge exchange and foster collaborations between these projects and their creators/contributors, and also to encourage contributions and participation from MozFest attendees who are interested in this problem domain, but may be unaware of opportunities.

Presenters will get constructive, diverse feedback from other technologists and open research enthusiasts, and participants would learn about the application of cutting-edge machine learning and AI technologies in open science and opportunities to contribute.

This session follows in the footsteps of #ossoapbox sessions from previous MozFests.

3. What will happen in your session?
* We will recruit innovators working in this problem space to give lightning talks (3-5 mins) on their current projects and/or ideas. These will be followed by a Q&A session of 5 mins. 
* Prior to the session, we will collect a brief summary of the project from presenters, focussed on requests for feedback/comments so to facilitate 
* We encourage presentations to be focussed on ways to contribute and opportunities for integration with other open tool stacks (we may provide some guiding questions) Spontaneous presentations are encouraged!
* Participants are encouraged to live tweet via the hashtag #ossoapbox
* The whole session will be live-streamed if the quality of internet can support this; remote participants can present and/or ask questions
* We may get a sketch noter and/or microblog these presentations
* If projects have live demos, presentators are encouraged to stay behind the session and engage attendees in more hands-on demos and user-testing. 

4. Post-Mozfest how will you continue this work from the session with your participants?
* We will write up a summary of the projects and session to post on [eLife Labs](www.elifesci.org/labs); any presenters/contributors interested can also elaborate on their projects/ideas by pitching a post to Labs.
* Microblogs potentially to be published on other relevant platforms
* We will invite interested participants to share updates on the open-source community call, organised every 4 months (next one is Feb 2020).
* Depending on the level of enthusiasm, we could start a newsletter to keep the community of innovators updated and engaged.

5. How much time you will need? (< 60min / 60min / 90min / All weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session)

Depending on the number of presentations, 60-90mins

6. How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session? What if 30 participants attend? What if there are 3?

If nobody at the venue attends, we would have more in-depth discussions and feedback between the presenters. 

We would love to have more participants of all levels of prior knowledge! This will really allow presenters to get more diverse feedback and hone their communication skills. 

7. Session format - choose 1 of the following 3:
   * Learning Forum: Sessions under this format develop and implement ideas for improvement, exchange or review
   * Gallery: This format hosts interactive exhibits, installations, games, stalls- designed for 1:1 self driven experiences or small group activities. Often these experiences or activities are not scheduled time blocks but take place over the day or weekend allowing access and interaction at any time.
   * Workshop: Sessions under this format require hands-on making, hacking and prototyping. These sessions will ask participants to create and build code, objects or crafts

Learning forum

8. Accessibility requirements
* Attendees need to understand English.
* We can try to use Google slide's live captioning to provide captions? Not sure practically if that would work.

9. Language, and whether we would need translation

English
