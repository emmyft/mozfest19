## Questions to answer
1. What is the name of your session? 
2. What is the goal or outcome of your session?
3. What will happen in your session?
4. Post-Mozfest how will you continue this work from the session with your participants?
5. How much time you will need? (< 60min / 60min / 90min / All weekend, as an installation, exhibit or drop-in session)
6. How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session? What if 30 participants attend? What if there are 3?
7. Session format - choose 1 of the following 3:
   * Learning Forum: Sessions under this format develop and implement ideas for improvement, exchange or review
   * Gallery: This format hosts interactive exhibits, installations, games, stalls- designed for 1:1 self driven experiences or small group activities. Often these experiences or activities are not scheduled time blocks but take place over the day or weekend allowing access and interaction at any time.
   * Workshop: Sessions under this format require hands-on making, hacking and prototyping. These sessions will ask participants to create and build code, objects or crafts

8. Accessibility requirements
9. Language, and whether we would need translation

## Working idea: Democratising citation and research annotation/evaluation
### Goals
* Encourage discussions around citation best practices
* Test out ideas of democratising citation/annotation/evaluation to get feedback
* Increase awareness of the issues surrounding current citation practices
* Can we use AI to help?

### What happens in the session (desperately need more ideas/refining)
* Introductory presentation (10 mins) - current practices
* A presentation/discussion on how AI can help? 

#### random brainstorm of ideas
* Public annotation session – can we get the public to help fill in missing citations? (paper/software) if something like [this](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/685263v1#comment-4524007465) could happen that would be amazing (scroll to the comments at the bottom)
* (an easier version of the above) Public annotation of the _context_ of the citation – participants to classify citations with emojis?
* Participant to understand what a citation is actually referring to (and how difficult it is to actually figure that out): give them a paragraph on a paper followed by the original article, ask them to find the corresponding bit of the cited paper that was actually cited.
* 

### post-mozfest idea
* Blog post on eLife Labs
* If we are actually user-testing a prototype/UI, we can further develop it
